Geometric Shapes Calculator
This project is a basic Java application with a graphical user interface (GUI) to calculate the area and perimeter (or circumference) of different geometric shapes. 
The user can select from three shapes: Rectangle, Square, or Circle, and input the required dimensions to get the results.

Features:
Supported Shapes: Rectangle, Square, Circle.
User-Friendly Interface: Built using Java Swing for easy interaction.
Instant Calculations: Calculates and displays the area and perimeter based on user input.
How to Run:
Compile and run the project using any Java IDE (e.g., NetBeans, IntelliJ, etc.).
Select the shape from the dropdown menu.
Enter the required dimensions (width/height for rectangles, side for squares, radius for circles).
Click "Calculate" to see the area and perimeter.
